          <h3>Primary Email Contact</h3>
          <div class="contact-info">
            <p class="contact-detail"><strong>Administrator Email:</strong> admin@picraft.org</p>
            <p class="response-time">Typical Response: 12-24 hours</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="method-details">
            <h4>When to Use Email Contact</h4>
            <p>Email serves as our primary official communication channel for matters requiring documentation, detailed technical explanations, or formal administrative review. This method is particularly appropriate for complex issues that benefit from thoughtful, detailed responses rather than immediate back-and-forth discussion.</p>
            
            <h4>Appropriate Email Topics</h4>
            <ul class="topic-list">
              <li><strong>Ban Appeals:</strong> Formal appeals of disciplinary actions with detailed explanations and evidence</li>
              <li><strong>Technical Issues:</strong> Server connectivity problems, client compatibility issues, or gameplay bugs</li>
              <li><strong>Griefing Reports:</strong> Detailed reports of rule violations with coordinates, timestamps, and evidence</li>
              <li><strong>Community Disputes:</strong> Conflicts between players requiring administrative mediation</li>
              <li><strong>Suggestions and Feedback:</strong> Detailed proposals for server improvements or policy changes</li>
              <li><strong>Partnership Inquiries:</strong> Requests for collaboration, content creation partnerships, or community events</li>
              <li><strong>Privacy Concerns:</strong> Requests for data deletion, account information, or privacy-related issues</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Email Best Practices</h4>
            <p><strong>Subject Line Clarity:</strong> Use specific, descriptive subject lines that immediately convey the nature of your inquiry. Examples: "Ban Appeal - [Username] - [Date]" or "Griefing Report - Coordinates [X, Y, Z]"</p>
            
            <p><strong>Detailed Information:</strong> Include all relevant details in your initial email to avoid delays caused by follow-up questions. For technical issues, include your Minecraft version, operating system, and any error messages. For rule violation reports, include coordinates, approximate times, and any screenshots or evidence.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Professional Tone:</strong> Maintain respectful, professional communication even when discussing frustrating situations. Clear, factual descriptions of problems are more effective than emotional appeals or demands.</p>

          <h3>In-Game Administrative Contact</h3>
          <div class="contact-info">
            <p class="contact-detail"><strong>Staff Identification:</strong> Look for [Admin] or [Mod] prefixes in chat</p>
            <p class="response-time">Immediate for urgent issues</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="method-details">
            <h4>When to Use In-Game Contact</h4>
            <p>In-game communication with staff members is most appropriate for immediate issues requiring real-time response, such as active griefing incidents, player harassment, or technical problems affecting current gameplay. This method provides the fastest response for urgent situations but may not be suitable for complex issues requiring detailed discussion.</p>
            
            <h4>In-Game Contact Protocols</h4>
            <ul class="topic-list">
              <li><strong>Emergency Situations:</strong> Active griefing, harassment, or cheating requiring immediate intervention</li>
              <li><strong>Technical Problems:</strong> Immediate gameplay issues like being stuck, lost items due to bugs, or connectivity problems</li>
              <li><strong>Quick Questions:</strong> Brief clarifications about rules, server mechanics, or current events</li>
              <li><strong>Real-Time Assistance:</strong> Help with commands, gameplay mechanics, or navigation issues</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Staff Availability:</strong> While staff members maintain regular presence on the server, availability varies by time zone and real-world schedules. If no staff members are currently online, please use email or forum contact methods for non-emergency issues.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Respectful Communication:</strong> Remember that staff members are volunteers contributing their time to maintain a positive community environment. Approach in-game staff contact with patience and respect, understanding that complex issues may need to be moved to email or forum discussion.</p>

          <h2>Communication Policies and Response Expectations</h2>
          
          <div class="policy-section">
            <h3>Response Time Commitments</h3>
            <p><strong>Standard Inquiries:</strong> Non-urgent questions, suggestions, and general communication typically receive responses within 24-48 hours, depending on complexity and current administrative workload.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Technical Issues:</strong> Server problems, connectivity issues, and gameplay bugs receive priority attention, with acknowledgment within 12 hours and resolution timeframes communicated based on problem complexity.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Emergency Situations:</strong> Active rule violations, player safety concerns, and server stability issues receive immediate attention when staff are available, with follow-up communication about resolution progress.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Ban Appeals:</strong> Formal disciplinary appeals undergo thorough review processes that may require 3-7 days for complete investigation and response, ensuring fair consideration of all evidence and circumstances.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="policy-section">
            <h3>Privacy and Confidentiality</h3>
            <p><strong>Personal Information Protection:</strong> All player communications with administration are treated as confidential unless public discussion is specifically requested or required for community transparency.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Evidence and Documentation:</strong> Screenshots, chat logs, and other evidence provided to administration are used solely for the purpose of resolving the reported issue and are not shared beyond necessary staff members.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Account Security:</strong> Administrative staff will never request passwords, personal information, or account details through any communication channel. Legitimate administrative contact focuses on in-game issues and community matters.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="policy-section">
            <h3>Communication Standards</h3>
            <p><strong>Professional Interaction:</strong> All communication with administration should maintain respectful, constructive tones focused on problem-solving and community improvement rather than personal attacks or emotional venting.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Factual Accuracy:</strong> Provide accurate, complete information when reporting issues or making requests. Intentionally misleading administration or providing false information may result in additional disciplinary action.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Constructive Feedback:</strong> Criticism and suggestions are welcome when presented constructively with specific examples, proposed solutions, and respect for the volunteer nature of server administration.</p>
