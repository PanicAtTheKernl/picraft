            <h3>Community-Centered Development</h3>
            <div class="philosophy-content">
              <p><strong>Collaborative Building:</strong> Server policies and infrastructure encourage collaborative projects, resource sharing, and community interaction rather than isolated individual play or competitive resource hoarding.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Democratic Decision Making:</strong> Significant server changes, protection policies, and community standards develop through community discussion and consensus rather than administrative decree, ensuring server evolution reflects player needs and preferences.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Inclusive Environment:</strong> Community standards prioritize welcoming new players, supporting different play styles, and maintaining an environment where players of all experience levels can contribute meaningfully to server culture.</p>

            <h3>Technical Excellence and Sustainability</h3>
            <div class="philosophy-content">
              <p><strong>Sustainable Infrastructure:</strong> Raspberry Pi hosting demonstrates that community servers can achieve professional reliability and performance while maintaining environmental sustainability and cost-effectiveness.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Transparent Operation:</strong> Open communication about technical decisions, performance metrics, and infrastructure development builds community trust and provides educational value about server management and optimization.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Future-Focused Design:</strong> Infrastructure and community policies are designed to support organic growth, technological advancement, and evolving player needs while maintaining core values and gameplay authenticity.</p>

            <h3>Balance of Protection and Freedom</h3>
            <div class="philosophy-content">
              <p><strong>Minimal Restrictions:</strong> Protection systems focus on preserving community spaces and enabling grief recovery rather than restricting player creativity, exploration, or legitimate competitive gameplay.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Open World Access:</strong> The vast majority of the server world remains completely open for unrestricted building, resource gathering, and exploration, maintaining the freedom and risk that define authentic survival gameplay.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Community-Driven Protection:</strong> Protected areas develop organically through community consensus about spaces that benefit from security measures, rather than pre-determined restrictions imposed without player input.</p>

                  <p><strong>Automated World Backups:</strong> World data, player information, and plugin configurations are backed up every 30 minutes during active play periods, ensuring minimal data loss potential even in worst-case scenarios.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Full System Backups:</strong> Complete server snapshots including operating system, configurations, and all data are performed daily during low-activity periods, providing comprehensive recovery capabilities for major system issues.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Retention Policies:</strong> Multiple backup generations are maintained to enable recovery from various timeframes, balancing storage requirements with comprehensive recovery options.</p>
