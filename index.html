          <h2>Fresh Start Survival Experience</h2>
          <p>Pi Craft is a brand new Minecraft survival server launching with authentic gameplay mechanics that honor the classic Minecraft experience. We've carefully designed our server environment to eliminate pay-to-win mechanics, starter kits, and artificial advantages while implementing intelligent protection systems that preserve the integrity of shared spaces without interfering with wilderness survival gameplay.</p>
          
          <p>As a completely fresh server, every player joins on equal footing with access to pristine, unexplored terrain rich with untouched resources. There are no established player kingdoms, no claimed territories, and no veteran players with massive advantages. This is your opportunity to be among the founding members of what we envision will become a thriving, close-knit community built on principles of fair play and mutual respect.</p>

          <p>Our approach prioritizes authentic survival mechanics while strategically implementing modern server management tools that enhance rather than detract from the core gameplay experience. Every plugin decision has been made with careful consideration of how it impacts player agency, server stability, and community dynamics.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="features-grid">
          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Authentic Survival-First Gameplay</h3>
            <p>The core Minecraft survival experience remains completely intact and unmodified. Players must gather resources through mining, farming, and exploration exactly as intended by the original game design. There are no teleportation commands, no free items, no starter kits, and no economy shortcuts that would undermine the satisfaction of earning progress through genuine effort and skill.</p>
            
            <p>Hunger, health, and death mechanics function exactly as expected, with players losing items upon death and needing to retrieve them within the standard despawn timer. Mob spawning, ore generation, and biome distribution follow vanilla algorithms, ensuring that resource scarcity and abundance feel natural and rewarding.</p>

            <p>The day-night cycle, weather patterns, and seasonal mechanics (where applicable) operate without modification, preserving the rhythm and pacing that makes Minecraft survival engaging and challenging.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Brand New World Opportunities</h3>
            <p>Joining a fresh server means access to completely unexplored terrain with virgin ore deposits, untouched structures, and pristine biomes waiting for discovery. Every dungeon, stronghold, and naturally generated structure contains its original loot tables, and no areas have been strip-mined or depleted by previous players.</p>
            
            <p>The world generation uses the latest Minecraft algorithms, ensuring access to all current biomes, structures, and generation features. Players can establish bases in prime locations, discover rare biomes, and have genuine exploration experiences without worrying about whether someone else has already claimed or depleted the best spots.</p>

            <p>This is a unique opportunity to participate in the organic development of server culture, establish founding settlements, create the first major builds, and help determine the social norms and community standards that will guide the server's growth.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Reliable Raspberry Pi Infrastructure</h3>
            <p>Our server runs on a Raspberry Pi 5 equipped with high-speed storage and backed by an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system that maintains operation during brief power outages. This setup provides consistent performance while maintaining the charm and sustainability of running on dedicated single-board computer hardware.</p>
            
            <p>The UPS system includes battery backup capable of sustaining server operation for extended periods during power disruptions, with automatic graceful shutdown procedures to prevent data corruption during longer outages. Network redundancy ensures connectivity remains stable even if primary internet connections experience issues.</p>

            <p>Regular automated backups preserve world data and player progress, with both local and remote backup storage ensuring that community builds and individual progress remain safe from hardware failures or other technical issues.</p>

          <h2>Comprehensive Server Enhancement Systems</h2>
          <p>Our plugin selection represents months of research and testing to identify tools that enhance server management and community protection without compromising the authentic survival experience. Each plugin serves a specific purpose in maintaining server integrity, preventing malicious behavior, and providing administrative capabilities necessary for professional server operation.</p>
          
          <div class="plugins-grid">
            <div class="plugin-category">
              <h3>Anti-Griefing and Protection Infrastructure</h3>
              <p>These systems work together to create a protective framework that preserves community spaces while maintaining complete freedom in wilderness areas.</p>
              
              <div class="plugin-details">
                <h4>WorldGuard Protection System</h4>
                <p>WorldGuard serves as our primary region protection tool, currently configured with minimal spawn area protection to prevent immediate griefing of the server's arrival point. As the community develops and players create shared spaces, collaborative projects, or community infrastructure, WorldGuard regions can be established democratically to protect these investments.</p>
                
                <p>The system supports granular permission controls, allowing for different levels of access within protected areas. For example, a community building project might allow all trusted players to contribute while preventing accidental damage from newer players still learning the server culture.</p>

                <h4>CoreProtect Logging and Recovery</h4>
                <p>CoreProtect maintains a comprehensive database of every block placement, destruction, and interaction on the server. This invisible background system enables precise rollback of griefing incidents without affecting legitimate nearby builds or changes made by other players.</p>
                
                <p>The system tracks player actions with timestamp precision, allowing administrators to investigate incidents thoroughly and apply surgical fixes that restore griefed areas to their exact previous state while preserving all legitimate changes made before, during, or after the incident.</p>

                <h4>Advanced Anti-Cheat Detection</h4>
                <p>Our anti-cheat system monitors player behavior for impossible movements, block break speeds, and other indicators of client modifications or exploits. The system is calibrated to avoid false positives while catching genuine attempts to gain unfair advantages through hacking clients, x-ray texture packs, or movement exploits.</p>
                
                <p>Rather than immediately banning suspected players, the system flags suspicious behavior for administrative review, ensuring that network lag, unusual but legitimate play patterns, or client quirks don't result in unfair punishments.</p>
                
              </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="plugin-category">

                <p>EssentialsX provides fundamental administrative commands for server management, player assistance, and moderation tasks. The plugin is configured with conservative permissions that prioritize maintaining authentic gameplay over convenience features.</p>
                
                <p>Most convenience commands like teleportation, item spawning, or bypassing game mechanics are disabled for regular players, with exceptions made only for specific administrative tasks or emergency situations that require staff intervention.</p>

                <h4>LuckPerms Permission Framework</h4>
                <p>LuckPerms manages the complex permission structures needed to operate plugins safely while ensuring that regular players maintain equal access to game mechanics. The permission system is designed with multiple staff roles and careful privilege separation to prevent abuse.</p>
                
                <p>New players start with identical permissions, and any elevated privileges are earned through community contribution and demonstrated trustworthiness rather than monetary payment or favoritism.</p>

                <h4>DiscordSRV Community Bridge</h4>
                <p>DiscordSRV creates a seamless communication bridge between our Discord community and in-game chat, allowing players to stay connected with the community even when not actively playing. The integration includes role synchronization and moderation tools that help maintain consistent community standards across platforms.</p>
                
                <p>The system respects player privacy with optional participation and provides tools for managing cross-platform communication effectively without creating spam or disrupting either environment.</p>

                <h4>Vault Economic Framework</h4>
                <p>Vault provides the underlying economic API that will support future community trading systems as the server develops. Currently configured for basic functionality, it will enable player-driven markets, trading posts, and other economic interactions as the community grows large enough to support them.</p>

              <div class="plugin-details">
                <h4>Dynmap Live World Visualization</h4>
                <p>Dynmap generates a real-time, web-accessible map of the server world that updates as players explore and build. This tool helps players coordinate builds, plan expeditions, and appreciate the scope of community projects without requiring any in-game commands or modifications.</p>
                
                <p>The map respects player privacy with configurable visibility options and provides valuable tools for server administrators to monitor world development and identify potential issues before they become problems.</p>

                <h4>TreeAssist Forestry Enhancement</h4>
                <p>TreeAssist provides optional realistic tree felling mechanics that allow players to efficiently harvest trees while maintaining realistic physics and resource consumption. Players can choose whether to use this feature, ensuring that those who prefer traditional block-by-block harvesting can continue with their preferred method.</p>
                
                <p>The system prevents floating tree tops and ensures that tree harvesting feels natural while respecting player choice and maintaining game balance.</p>

                <h4>Democratic Sleep Voting</h4>
                <p>Rather than requiring all online players to sleep simultaneously, our sleep voting system allows the server to skip night when a majority of active players vote to sleep. This democratic approach respects individual player preferences while preventing small groups from forcing extended night periods on the entire community.</p>

                <h4>Custom Head Collection System</h4>
                <p>Players can access decorative head blocks featuring various designs for enhanced building creativity. These cosmetic items provide no gameplay advantages but offer additional aesthetic options for detailed builds and creative projects.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          
          <div class="protection-info">
            <h3>Current Protection Philosophy and Future Plans</h3>
            <p><strong>Starting State:</strong> As a brand new server, we begin with minimal protection - only basic spawn area security to ensure players can join safely and get oriented without immediate griefing concerns.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Community-Driven Development:</strong> Protected areas will develop organically as our community grows and identifies spaces that benefit from security measures. We believe in democratic decision-making about what deserves protection rather than imposing arbitrary restrictions.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Wilderness Freedom:</strong> The overwhelming majority of the world will always remain completely open for unrestricted exploration, building, and survival gameplay. Our goal is to protect community investments, not to restrict player freedom or creativity.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Adaptive Management:</strong> As the server develops its unique culture and community needs become clearer, our protection systems will evolve to serve the community's actual requirements rather than predetermined assumptions about what players want or need.</p>
