            <div class="update-meta">
              <time datetime="2025-08-20">20 August 2025</time>

            <div class="update-summary">
              <p>Comprehensive JVM optimization implementation has resulted in significant performance improvements, with tick rate stability achieving consistent 20 TPS even under moderate player loads and active chunk generation scenarios.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="technical-details">
              <h3>Technical Implementation Details</h3>
              
              <div class="detail-section">
                <h4>JVM Flag Optimization</h4>
                <p>Implemented carefully researched JVM flags specifically tailored for Minecraft server operation on ARM64 architecture. These optimizations focus on garbage collection efficiency, memory allocation patterns, and thread management to maximize performance within the Raspberry Pi 5's hardware constraints.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Garbage Collection Tuning:</strong> Configured G1 garbage collector with optimized heap sizing and collection frequency to minimize pause times during active gameplay. This reduces the brief lag spikes that can occur during memory management operations, particularly when multiple players are exploring new terrain simultaneously.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Memory Allocation Optimization:</strong> Adjusted initial and maximum heap sizes to utilize available system memory efficiently while maintaining sufficient overhead for operating system functions and background processes. Current allocation uses 6GB of the available 8GB RAM, with the remainder reserved for system operations and plugin overhead.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="detail-section">
                <h4>Performance Metrics and Monitoring</h4>
                <p><strong>Tick Rate Stability:</strong> Server tick rate now maintains consistent 20 TPS (ticks per second) during normal operation, with brief dips to 18-19 TPS only during intensive operations like large-scale world generation or multiple players performing resource-intensive activities simultaneously.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Chunk Loading Performance:</strong> Chunk generation and loading times have improved by approximately 15-20%, resulting in smoother exploration experiences and reduced waiting times when players venture into previously unexplored areas of the world.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Memory Usage Optimization:</strong> Memory usage patterns show more efficient allocation and cleanup cycles, reducing the frequency of garbage collection events that can cause brief performance impacts during gameplay.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="detail-section">
                <h4>Player Experience Improvements</h4>
                <p><strong>Reduced Lag Spikes:</strong> The most noticeable improvement for players is the significant reduction in lag spikes during terrain exploration and chunk loading. Players should experience smoother movement and block interaction, particularly when venturing into new areas or during peak activity periods.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Enhanced Stability:</strong> Overall server stability has improved, with reduced instances of brief connection hiccups or delayed block updates that could previously occur during high-activity periods.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Concurrent Player Support:</strong> These optimizations better prepare the server for handling larger numbers of concurrent players as the community grows, ensuring consistent performance scaling.</p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <div class="future-monitoring">
              <h3>Ongoing Performance Monitoring</h3>
              <p>Performance monitoring systems continue to track these improvements and identify additional optimization opportunities. Players experiencing any performance issues are encouraged to report them through our community forum or administration contact methods, as this feedback helps identify edge cases or specific scenarios that may benefit from further optimization.</p>
