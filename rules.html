          <h2>Community Standards Philosophy</h2>
          <p>Pi Craft operates on a fundamental principle of mutual respect and common sense behavior. Rather than creating an exhaustive list of prohibited actions, we focus on fostering a community culture where players understand that their actions affect others and take responsibility for contributing positively to the shared experience.</p>
          
          <p>Our approach emphasizes community self-regulation, educational responses to problems, and collaborative solutions that strengthen rather than divide our player base. We believe that clear communication about expectations, consistent enforcement of reasonable standards, and opportunities for learning and growth create a more positive environment than punitive rule systems.</p>

          <div class="core-principle">
            <h3>The Golden Rule of Pi Craft</h3>
            <p class="golden-rule"><strong>Do not be an idiot.</strong></p>
            <p>This encompasses treating others with respect, using common sense in your interactions, considering how your actions affect the community, and taking responsibility for maintaining the positive atmosphere that makes Pi Craft an enjoyable place for everyone.</p>

          <h2>Behavioral Standards and Community Expectations</h2>
          
          <div class="rule-section">
            <h3>Respectful Communication and Interaction</h3>
            <div class="rule-details">
              <h4>Chat Conduct and Communication Standards</h4>
              <p><strong>Appropriate Language:</strong> Use language appropriate for all ages and backgrounds. While casual conversation is encouraged, avoid profanity, offensive language, discriminatory terms, or content that could make others uncomfortable or unwelcome in our community.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Spam Prevention:</strong> Avoid repetitive messages, excessive capital letters, flooding chat with similar content, or other disruptive communication patterns that interfere with normal community conversation and information sharing.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Constructive Discussion:</strong> Engage in conversations that contribute positively to community interaction. Disagreements and different opinions are welcome when expressed respectfully and constructively rather than through personal attacks or hostile confrontation.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Privacy and Personal Information:</strong> Respect other players' privacy by not sharing personal information without consent, avoiding persistent questioning about private matters, and maintaining appropriate boundaries in community interactions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="rule-details">
              <h4>Community Interaction and Social Standards</h4>
              <p><strong>Inclusive Environment:</strong> Welcome new players, assist community members who need help, and contribute to an environment where players of all experience levels feel valued and included in server activities and discussions.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Conflict Resolution:</strong> Handle disputes through respectful discussion, seek administrative assistance when needed, and focus on finding solutions that benefit the community rather than escalating conflicts or creating division among players.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Cultural Sensitivity:</strong> Respect the diverse backgrounds, beliefs, and perspectives of community members. Avoid content, jokes, or references that could be offensive to others based on cultural, religious, ethnic, or personal characteristics.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="rule-section">
            <h3>Gameplay Integrity and Fair Play</h3>
            <div class="rule-details">
              <h4>Anti-Griefing Policies and Property Respect</h4>
              <p><strong>Build Respect:</strong> Do not deliberately damage, modify, or destroy other players' constructions without explicit permission. This includes private bases, public community projects, infrastructure, farms, and decorative builds that clearly represent someone's effort and creativity.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Resource Theft Prevention:</strong> Avoid taking items from other players' storage systems, private chests, or clearly marked resource collections without permission. While the world is open for resource gathering, respect obvious private property and community resources.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Malicious Behavior:</strong> Do not engage in activities specifically designed to annoy, frustrate, or drive away other players. This includes but is not limited to deliberately blocking access to areas, creating offensive structures, or repeatedly interfering with other players' projects.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Community Space Respect:</strong> Treat shared spaces, spawn areas, community projects, and collaborative builds with extra care and consideration. These spaces represent collective community effort and should be protected and enhanced rather than damaged or misused.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="rule-details">
              <h4>Cheating and Exploit Prevention</h4>
              <p><strong>Client Modification Restrictions:</strong> Use only legitimate Minecraft clients without unauthorized modifications that provide gameplay advantages. This includes prohibitions on x-ray texture packs, flying clients, speed hacks, auto-mining tools, and other cheat clients or modifications.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Game Exploit Avoidance:</strong> Do not exploit game mechanics, server bugs, or plugin vulnerabilities to gain unfair advantages, duplicate items, bypass intended limitations, or disrupt server operation. Report discovered exploits to administration rather than using them.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Fair Competition:</strong> Compete fairly with other players through skill, creativity, and legitimate resource gathering rather than through cheating, exploitation, or gaining advantages through prohibited methods or external tools.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Account Integrity:</strong> Use only your own legitimate Minecraft account and do not share account access with others, use alternative accounts to bypass restrictions, or engage in activities that compromise account security or server integrity.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="rule-section">
            <h3>Content Standards and Community Guidelines</h3>
            <div class="rule-details">
              <h4>Appropriate Content Creation</h4>
              <p><strong>Family-Friendly Builds:</strong> Create structures and content appropriate for players of all ages. Avoid builds with offensive imagery, inappropriate themes, or content that could make others uncomfortable or violate community standards.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Creative Expression:</strong> Express creativity through builds, projects, and community contributions while respecting community standards and considering how your creations affect the shared environment and other players' experiences.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Public Space Consideration:</strong> When building in areas visible to other players or near community spaces, consider how your projects complement the overall aesthetic and community atmosphere rather than creating jarring or inappropriate additions to shared areas.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="rule-details">
              <h4>Information Sharing and External Content</h4>
              <p><strong>Appropriate Link Sharing:</strong> Share external links, images, or content only when relevant to community discussion and appropriate for all community members. Avoid sharing content that violates community standards or could be harmful to other players.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Advertising Restrictions:</strong> Avoid excessive promotion of external servers, services, or personal projects unless directly relevant to community discussion or approved by administration for community benefit.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Educational Content:</strong> Share helpful information, tutorials, and educational content that benefits the community while ensuring accuracy and appropriateness for the server's family-friendly environment.</p>

          <h2>Rule Enforcement and Community Management</h2>
          
          <div class="enforcement-section">
            <h3>Progressive Discipline and Educational Approach</h3>
            <div class="discipline-details">
              <h4>First Response and Education</h4>
              <p><strong>Educational Priority:</strong> Initial rule violations typically result in educational conversations focused on explaining community standards, discussing why certain behaviors are problematic, and helping players understand how to contribute positively to the community.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Community Support:</strong> Fellow community members are encouraged to help new players understand server culture and expectations through friendly guidance and positive examples rather than confrontational corrections or public shaming.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Administrative Guidance:</strong> Staff members provide clear explanations of expectations, offer suggestions for better approaches to situations, and work with players to prevent future issues through understanding rather than punishment.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="discipline-details">
              <h4>Escalation Procedures</h4>
              <p><strong>Repeated Violations:</strong> Players who continue problematic behavior after education and warnings face progressively more serious consequences designed to protect the community while providing opportunities for behavioral correction.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Temporary Restrictions:</strong> Temporary mutes, building restrictions, or brief suspensions may be imposed to give players time to reflect on their behavior and demonstrate commitment to following community standards.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Permanent Consequences:</strong> Permanent bans are reserved for severe violations, repeated serious offenses, or cases where players demonstrate unwillingness to participate constructively in the community despite multiple opportunities for correction.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="discipline-details">
              <h4>Appeal Process and Second Chances</h4>
              <p><strong>Fair Appeal System:</strong> All disciplinary actions can be appealed through formal processes that include evidence review, consideration of circumstances, and evaluation of player commitment to following community standards.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Rehabilitation Focus:</strong> Appeals are evaluated based on demonstrated understanding of problems, commitment to positive community participation, and evidence of changed behavior or attitude toward community standards.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Community Input:</strong> When appropriate, community input may be considered in disciplinary decisions, particularly for cases involving community disputes or situations where player testimony provides valuable context.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="enforcement-section">
            <h3>Investigation and Evidence Standards</h3>
            <div class="investigation-details">
              <h4>Thorough Investigation Procedures</h4>
              <p><strong>Evidence Collection:</strong> Rule violation reports undergo thorough investigation using server logs, player reports, screenshot evidence, and other available information to ensure accurate understanding of situations before disciplinary action.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Player Perspective:</strong> Accused players receive opportunities to explain their actions, provide context for situations, and present their perspective before final decisions are made about appropriate responses.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Witness Testimony:</strong> When relevant, witness accounts from other players provide additional context and perspective about incidents, though all testimony is evaluated for accuracy and potential bias.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="investigation-details">
              <h4>Privacy and Confidentiality</h4>
              <p><strong>Information Protection:</strong> Investigation details, evidence, and player information are kept confidential among relevant staff members and are not shared publicly unless necessary for community protection or transparency.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Respectful Process:</strong> Investigations are conducted respectfully with focus on facts rather than personal attacks, maintaining dignity for all involved parties while ensuring thorough evaluation of situations.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Documentation Standards:</strong> All significant disciplinary actions are documented for consistency, appeal purposes, and to ensure fair treatment across similar situations and different players.</p>

          <div class="conclusion-content">
            <p><strong>Adaptive Standards:</strong> These rules represent current community standards and expectations, but they evolve based on community growth, changing needs, and collective learning about what creates the most positive environment for all participants.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Community Input:</strong> Rule modifications, policy changes, and community standard adjustments include community discussion and input to ensure that guidelines reflect actual player needs and community values rather than arbitrary administrative preferences.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong> We regularly evaluate rule effectiveness, enforcement fairness, and community satisfaction with current standards to identify improvements that could create a better experience for all community members.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Questions and Clarifications:</strong> Players who have questions about rules, need clarification about specific situations, or want to discuss community standards are encouraged to contact administration or participate in community forum discussions about community policies and guidelines.</p>

          <div class="final-message">
            <h3>Remember: Common Sense and Respect</h3>
            <p>Above all specific rules and policies, Pi Craft operates on principles of common sense, mutual respect, and community responsibility. When in doubt about whether an action is appropriate, consider how it affects others, whether it contributes positively to the community, and whether you would want to be treated similarly in the same situation.</p>
            
            <p>Our goal is creating a community where everyone can enjoy authentic Minecraft survival gameplay in a supportive, welcoming environment that brings out the best in both the game and the people who play it together.</p>
